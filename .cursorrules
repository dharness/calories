# Code Modularity Rules

## General Principles
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into separate modules
- Try not to use ternary operators. Use if/else statements instead unless it is a very simple condition (and move to function)
- Put random numbers and strings into constants at the top of the file

## File Organization
- One class/component per file
- Group related functionality into modules/packages
- Keep utility functions in separate files or services

## Code Structure
- Separate business logic from UI/presentation (follow best practices for the tool you are using)
- Keep configuration separate from implementation
- Use interfaces/types to define contracts between modules

Every route you make should be in its own file. 

#### Try-Catch
We do not need to try catch every little thing. Only try-catch if there is likely to be a big difficult to find error. Otherwise, focus on writing the code clean and concise and let the error propagate.
